So... pretty bad timing with trying to keep up with the posts but I'm slowly getting the hang of things...sort of. So, how it first started was I thought I was some sort of "Coding God" when I completed my 1st ever Blog. I was ecstatic I felt so good about my self knowing, "Hey, I made my own website!".  Then came a day where..well..it was incredibly not-understandable. I legit had no idea what the heck I was doing and I saw my classmates talking about things that I haven't even gotten to and it was very awful...and then came the <i>The Breakthrough</i>.
