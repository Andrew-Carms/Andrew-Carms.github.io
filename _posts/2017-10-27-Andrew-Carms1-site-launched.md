So...I'd say at first (roughly two weeks ago) I had no idea of how my Blog would even look or what it would have and I was practically with 0% of thoughts. Then I started looking around to my classmates' ideas and I sort of was getting the picture and laid out my 1st ever Blog ! <a href="https://codepen.io/Andrew-Carms/pen/XevXyW">Click Here</a>
