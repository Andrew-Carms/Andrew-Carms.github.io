Saturday...the 11th of November...it happened! So... it all started with me walking my dog and thinking to myself.."How the heck am I going to finish my Engineering homework when I don't even know where to start." Then, I walk back inside and sit in-front of my computer, just staring at what I had...and <i>it</i> came to me. The idea of looking at all the information that was given to me plus my previous work and I started basically "solving a puzzle". I was placing in, taking out bits & pieces while still trying to make sense out of it. And moments of refreshing..and refreshing..and refreshing my page to see if it came out how I wanted. And in the end, it did! Now that I'm looking at the time, I have spent 2 1/2 hours on this computer and it may sound crazy but...it was worth! Do you know how good I feel about myself knowing 'nothing' to being able to make sense out of everything that was put in-front of me. I can say right now, I figured out this whole puzzle in my chair, for 2 1/2 hours, using everything I so far knew plus the information given to me, <b>all by myself</b>.
...and it feels goood. :)
